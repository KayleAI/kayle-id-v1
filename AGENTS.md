# AI Engineering Rules

These rules exist to ensure that AI-generated contributions maintain **senior-level engineering quality**, avoid duplication, and respect the architecture of the codebase.

AI agents and contributors must follow these rules strictly.

---

# Environment Variables

The local stack reads from a single `.env` at the repo root. Do **not** hand-author it.

- `bun run env:setup` — writes a working `.env` with random local secrets + dummy third-party creds. Use this for any task that needs a local boot.
- `bun run env:pull` — pulls the shared dev secrets from Infisical Cloud (maintainers only).

Infisical is the source of truth for both dev and prod secrets. Production sync to Cloudflare Workers happens through the Infisical → Cloudflare integration; nothing in this repo pushes secrets at deploy time.

Two `.env.example` files survive as machine inputs to `wrangler types` and must stay in sync with the keys configured in Infisical:
- `apps/api/.env.example`
- `infra/face-matcher/.env.example`

When adding or removing a runtime env var, update the relevant `.env.example`, the Infisical project, and the `env:setup` script's dummy/random defaults if appropriate. Do not introduce new per-app `.env` files.

# Core Philosophy

The AI **must never invent structure**.

Architecture, patterns, and boundaries already exist in the repository. The AI's job is to **extend and maintain them**, not redesign them.

Prefer:

- modifying existing code
- reusing existing abstractions
- minimal diffs

Avoid:

- parallel implementations
- unnecessary abstractions
- architectural drift

---

# Mandatory Workflow

For any non-trivial change, follow this workflow.

## 1. Analyse Existing Code

Before writing any code:

- Search the repository for existing implementations.
- Identify patterns used in similar modules.
- Reuse existing utilities, services, hooks, or helpers.

Never implement functionality that already exists.

---

## 2. Plan Changes

Before implementation, determine:

- which files will change
- which functions will be modified
- whether existing logic can be reused
- whether any duplication can be removed

Prefer modifying existing code over adding new files.

---

## 3. Implement Minimal Changes

Implement the **smallest possible change** that solves the problem.

Rules:

- avoid unnecessary refactors
- avoid renaming unrelated code
- avoid moving files unless required
- avoid formatting-only commits

The diff should be as small and targeted as possible.

---

# Code Reuse Rules

## Search Before Creating

Before creating:

- functions
- utilities
- hooks
- services
- components
- types

you **must search the codebase** for an existing equivalent.

If a similar implementation exists:

- extend it
- refactor it
- or reuse it

Do **not** duplicate logic. And only create new files if absolutely necessary.

---

## One Concept, One Implementation

If multiple pieces of code implement the same behaviour:

- consolidate them
- remove duplication
- move shared logic to the appropriate layer

The codebase should maintain a **single source of truth** for each behaviour.

---

# Architectural Boundaries

Follow the architecture used by the repository.

General rules:

- UI components must not contain business logic
- Business logic must live in services/domain modules
- Data access should be isolated behind repository or data-layer abstractions
- Utilities must remain pure and side-effect free

Never mix these responsibilities.

---

# Dependency Rules

AI must not introduce new dependencies without explicit instruction.

Before adding a dependency:

- verify it does not already exist
- prefer internal utilities
- prefer native platform features

If external libraries are required, the AI must request approval.

---

# Import Rules

Prefer importing from existing internal modules.

Avoid:

- deep relative paths when aliases exist
- duplicate utility imports
- unused imports

Imports must follow the repository's existing ordering conventions.

---
# Component Rules (React)

React components must remain **thin orchestration layers**.

Components may:

- call hooks
- render UI
- trigger actions

Components must not:

- implement business logic
- contain complex data transformations
- duplicate domain logic

Complex logic must be moved into hooks, services, or domain modules.

---

# Function Design

Functions should follow these principles:

- small and focused
- single responsibility
- clear input/output behaviour

Prefer:

- early returns
- descriptive naming
- explicit types

Avoid:

- deeply nested conditionals
- hidden side effects
- large functions

---

# Abstraction Rules

Do not introduce new abstractions unless they are justified.

Acceptable reasons:

- eliminating duplication
- enforcing architectural boundaries
- improving testability

Unacceptable reasons:

- “future flexibility”
- speculative generalisation
- personal preference

If an abstraction is added, existing code must be updated to use it.

---

# Duplication Prevention

Duplication is considered a critical code quality issue.

Before committing code:

- search for similar logic
- consolidate duplicated behaviour
- reuse shared functions

If duplication is discovered, it must be resolved during the same change.

---

# Error Handling

Errors must be handled consistently across the codebase.

Rules:

- throw `Error` objects
- use descriptive messages
- avoid silent failures

Do not swallow errors unless explicitly required.

---

# Type Safety

TypeScript types must be treated as part of the architecture.

Rules:

- prefer explicit return types for exported functions
- avoid `any`
- prefer `unknown` when necessary
- use narrowing instead of assertions

Types should model domain concepts clearly.

---

# Code Changes Must Remain Consistent With Existing Patterns

Before writing new code, examine nearby files and follow:

- naming conventions
- file structure
- dependency patterns
- architectural boundaries

Consistency with the repository is more important than theoretical best practices.

---

# Performance Awareness

Avoid common performance pitfalls:

- unnecessary object/array allocations in loops
- repeated expensive computations
- recreating regex objects in loops
- unnecessary re-renders in React

Follow performance patterns already used in the repository.
Do not introduce new optimisation techniques unless necessary.

---

# No Parallel Implementations

AI must never introduce a second implementation of existing functionality.

Examples:

❌ create a second API client
❌ create another validation utility
❌ create a duplicate hook

Instead:

✔ extend the existing implementation
✔ refactor the existing module
✔ reuse shared utilities

---

# Testing Expectations

Changes that affect behaviour must include appropriate tests.

Tests should:

- verify behaviour
- remain deterministic
- avoid unnecessary complexity

Tests must not be skipped or disabled.

---

# Definition of Done

A change is complete only if:

- no duplication was introduced
- existing patterns were respected
- architecture boundaries remain intact
- naming is meaningful
- TypeScript types remain safe
- linting and formatting pass

---

# AI Output Expectations

AI-generated code must:

- integrate cleanly with existing modules
- avoid unnecessary abstractions
- reuse existing code
- produce minimal diffs
- follow repository conventions

If uncertain about architecture or module placement, the AI must **ask for clarification instead of guessing**.

---

# Final Rule

The AI must prioritise:

**clarity, reuse, consistency, and maintainability over cleverness or novelty.**

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `bun x ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `bun x ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `bun x ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides robust linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

---

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

---

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `bun x ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
