							<p>
								Kayle ID is identity verification infrastructure operated by
								Kayle Inc. This policy applies when you use the Kayle ID
								dashboard, API, webhook tooling, verification flows, or the
								Kayle ID mobile application.
							</p>
							<p>
								We serve two main groups of people: developers and teams who
								integrate Kayle ID into their products, and end-users who are
								asked by those products to complete a verification session.
							</p>
							<p>
								If another platform sends you to Kayle ID for verification, that
								platform also has its own privacy practices. In particular, that
								platform decides which claims it requests from you and what it
								does with the verification result it receives from Kayle ID.

						<LegalSection title="How We Use Information">
							<LegalList
								items={[
									"To authenticate developers, manage organizations, and secure access to the dashboard and API.",
									"To create verification sessions, build share contracts, and present the end-user with the claims requested by the relying party.",
									"To validate passport authenticity by checking chip data, including DG1, DG2, and SOD artifacts.",
									"To compare the passport chip portrait against captured selfies using Kayle ID's internal face-matching service.",
									"To generate verification status records, events, risk scores, and receiver-scoped identifiers such as the Kayle Document ID.",
									"To deliver the verification result and user-selected claims to the relying party through encrypted webhook payloads.",
									"To monitor service health, investigate abuse or failures, enforce our terms, and comply with legal obligations.",
								]}
							/>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="How Verification Data Moves Through Kayle ID">
							<p>
								A developer creates a verification session through the Kayle ID
								API and defines which claims may be requested. The user is then
								sent to a Kayle ID verification URL, which currently hands the
								session off into the Kayle ID iPhone app.
							</p>
							<p>
								During the active session, Kayle ID asks the user to consent,
								scans the passport photo page to prepare NFC access, reads the
								passport chip, and captures multiple selfies. Those artifacts
								are used to confirm document authenticity and compare the
								document portrait against the submitted selfies.
							</p>
							<p>
								After verification succeeds, Kayle ID asks the user which
								optional claims to share. The selected claims are packaged into
								a webhook payload that is encrypted to the developer's public
								key and signed with the webhook signing secret. Kayle ID stores
								that payload only in encrypted form for delivery and retry
								purposes.
							</p>

						<LegalSection title="What We Store and What We Do Not Store">

									We store
								</h3>
								<LegalList
									items={[
										"Developer account, organization, API key, webhook, and authentication records.",
										"Verification session and attempt metadata, including status, lifecycle phase, timestamps, app version, failure codes, and risk scores.",
										"Events and webhook delivery records, including encrypted webhook payloads and delivery attempt history.",
										"Hashed API keys, hashed mobile write tokens, and hashed device identifiers used to protect live session authentication.",
									]}

									]}
								/>
							</div>

							<p>
								Raw verification artifacts are processed in volatile session
								state while the verification is active. If a developer requests
								the <code>document_photo</code> claim and the user shares it,
								the resulting document portrait is included in the encrypted
								webhook payload delivered to that developer.
							</p>
						</LegalSection>

									"With the relying party that requested the verification, but only for the verification result and claims included in the session contract and selected by the user, except where a claim is marked required.",

						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Security">
							<p>
								We use technical and organizational measures designed to protect
								the data we handle. These include TLS in transit, secure and
								HTTP-only authentication cookies, hashed API keys, hashed
								handoff credentials, encrypted webhook signing secrets, and
								end-to-end encryption of webhook payloads to the developer's
								public key.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also restrict access to developer resources through
								organization membership controls and keep structured operational
								logs focused on service safety and troubleshooting rather than
								raw identity payloads.
							</p>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Retention">
							<LegalList
								items={[
									"Verification sessions currently expire 60 minutes after creation unless they are completed or cancelled earlier.",
									"Mobile handoff tokens currently expire five minutes after issuance.",
									"Magic-link and OTP sign-in verification records currently expire after 15 minutes.",
									"Raw verification artifacts are processed transiently and cleared from the live transfer state when the verification socket closes.",
									"Developer account records, session metadata, events, and encrypted webhook delivery records may be retained for operational, security, support, audit, fraud-prevention, and legal-compliance purposes.",

						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Your Choices and Rights">
							<p>
								Developers can manage organization membership, rotate or delete
								API keys, configure webhook endpoints and encryption keys, and
								stop creating new verification sessions at any time.
							</p>
							<p>
								End-users can choose whether to continue with a verification
								session and can decide which optional claims to share. Required
								claims cannot be deselected because they are part of the
								developer's session contract.
							</p>
							<p>
								Depending on where you live, you may have rights to request
								access, correction, deletion, or restriction of personal data.
								To make a request, email{" "}
								<a

									href="mailto:help@kayle.id"
								>
									help@kayle.id
								</a>
								. If your request concerns data that a relying party requested
								or received, we may direct you to that party because it controls
								how it uses the verification result on its side.

						<LegalSection title="Changes and Contact">
							<p>
								We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
								changes to the service, security practices, or legal
