						<LegalSection title="Who These Terms Cover">
							<p>
								These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of Kayle
								ID, including the developer dashboard, APIs, webhook tooling,
								verification URLs, and the Kayle ID mobile application.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you use Kayle ID on behalf of a company or other
								organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that
								organization to these terms. In that case, "you" includes both
								you and that organization.
							</p>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="The Service">
							<p>
								Kayle ID provides privacy-first identity verification
								infrastructure. Developers can create verification sessions,
								request specific claims, and receive results through encrypted
								webhooks. End-users can verify identity by completing a guided
								passport NFC and selfie flow.
							</p>
							<p>
								The current version of Kayle ID includes product limits. As of{" "}
								{LAST_UPDATED}, the hosted verification flow is centered on the
								Kayle ID iPhone app, browser completion is not supported, no
								liveness check is included, and device or document support may
								be limited. We may change, improve, suspend, or discontinue
								features at any time.
							</p>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Developer Accounts and Credentials">
							<LegalList
								items={[
									"You must provide accurate account and organization information and keep it up to date.",
									"You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, organization membership, API keys, webhook signing secrets, and private decryption keys.",
									"You must store credentials securely, rotate them when appropriate, and promptly disable or replace any credential you believe has been compromised.",
									"Kayle ID may rely on your organization settings, requested share fields, webhook URLs, and uploaded encryption keys exactly as configured by you.",
								]}
							/>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Verification Users and Consent">
							<p>
								If you are completing a verification session, you agree to
								follow the prompts in the Kayle ID flow and to provide the
								passport, selfies, permissions, and device access needed to
								complete the session.
							</p>
							<LegalList
								items={[
									"You must have the right to use the passport or other submitted material in the verification flow.",
									"You must grant the permissions needed for camera and NFC access if you want the flow to succeed.",
									"You may stop a verification session at any time, but the relying party may treat the session as incomplete, failed, expired, or cancelled.",
									"Optional claims can be declined, but required claims in the session contract cannot be deselected.",
								]}
							/>
						</LegalSection>

						<LegalSection title="Integrator Responsibilities">
							<p>
								If you integrate Kayle ID into your product, you remain
								responsible for your own onboarding, trust, fraud, compliance,
								and user-notice obligations.
							</p>
							<LegalList
								items={[
									"You must provide any notices, disclosures, consents, and lawful bases required before sending an end-user into a Kayle ID verification flow.",
									"You should request only the claims you reasonably need for your product or compliance use case.",
									"You are responsible for verifying webhook signatures, decrypting webhook payloads, securing your endpoint, and protecting the data you receive from Kayle ID.",
									"You are responsible for the decisions you make based on Kayle ID results, including any fraud, eligibility, onboarding, or access decisions.",
									"You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to your use of identity, document, biometric, and verification data.",
								]}

						<LegalSection title="Acceptable Use">

								the law, or threatens the service or its users.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may update these terms by posting a revised version on this
								site. Your continued use of Kayle ID after the updated terms
								take effect means you accept the revised terms.

						<LegalSection title="Disclaimers">
							<LegalList
								items={[
									'Kayle ID is provided "as is" and "as available" to the fullest extent permitted by law.',

								Provisions that by their nature should survive termination,
								including provisions about intellectual property, privacy,
								disclaimers, limitation of liability, and prior misuse, will
								survive.
